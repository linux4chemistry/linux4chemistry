It was published in Nucleic Acids Research (2011) Database Issue 39: D663-D669 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21051350). The regularly updated ASD v2.0 has expanded to 888 allosteric proteins, 544 allosteric diseases and 16212 allosteric modulators. Up-to-date classification and experimentally validated allosteric pathway have been integrated in the allosteric proteins. Structural pairs of orthosteric and allosteric sites in the allosteric proteins were added for researchers to develop allosteric pathway tools in terms of community demands. Allosteric DNAs and RNAs with experimental verification were added to ASD v2.0 as new types of targets. These updates are useful for facilitating the investigation of allosteric mechanism, allosteric target identification, and allosteric drug discovery. ASD v2.0 is freely available at http://mdl.shsmu.edu.cn/ASD/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ccl.net/cgi-bin/ccl/message-new?2013+03+08+002</guid><pubDate>Fri, 8 Mar 2013 10:45:42 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>CCL: 2013 CINF-RSC Scholarships for Scientific Excellence - Reminder</title><link>http://ccl.net/cgi-bin/ccl/message-new?2013+03+08+003</link><description>&lt;br/&gt;Sent to CCL by: "Guenter  Grethe" [ggrethe**att.net]&lt;br/&gt;2013 CINF Scholarship for Scientific Excellence Sponsored by the Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;br/&gt;The scholarship program of the Division of Chemical Information (CINF) of the American Chemical Society (ACS) funded by the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) is designed to reward graduate and postdoctoral students in chemical information and related sciences for scientific excellence and to foster their involvement in CINF.  &lt;br/&gt;Up to three scholarships valued at $1,000 each will be presented at the 246th ACS National Meeting in Indianapolis, IN, September 8  September 12, 2013.

Reaction &lt;br/&gt;barrier heights have been parameterized using published coupled cluster &lt;br/&gt;high-level/ab initio/calculations on the PM7 transition state and &lt;br/&gt;related ground state geometries (reactants and products).  It is fairly &lt;br/&gt;new so there is little published yet on how it performs against other &lt;br/&gt;methods.  However, it should be relatively very fast and inexpensive to &lt;br/&gt;compare it with your available data.

Crystallographers have a set of conventions (i.e. rules that are not based on any physics) regarding what a standard set of unit-cell parameters should look like. For example, if the unit-cell lengths a, b and c are equivalent by (but not related by) symmetry, some conventions state that the unit-cell parameters should be labeled such that a&lt;b&lt;c (or a&gt;b&gt;c, as with all arbitrary conventions, they are a matter of taste). For unit cells with two angles identical to 90 degrees based on the space-group symmetry, the convention is that the remaining angle should be called beta (or gamma according to some other conventions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space-group symmetry can also be standardised. For space group number 14, the standard setting is P 1 21/c 1 with the inversion at the origin, for example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most standardisation also includes the atomic coordinates: it is convenient if the atomic coordinates are reported in such a manner that they form a connected molecule without the need to apply the space-group symmetry (including translations) to generate symmetry-related copies, and the fractional coordinates of the centre of mass of the molecule should all be in the range [0, 1&gt; (perhaps even in the range [0,1/2&gt; or whatever, depending on the space-group symmetry). Also the number of atoms that should be reported is usually standardised to be restricted to the smallest set required to reconstruct the entire crystal structure (by applying the space-group symmetry).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The standardisation may also include the atom labeling itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Can it be used directly on the crystal structures&lt;br/&gt;&gt; obtained from experiments. (without changing the original information)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In principle, yes. In practice, some programs may either change the number of decimals (because they choose to save all files with a fixed number of decimal places, ignoring the input) and your coordinates may either gain some meaningless trailing zeros or lose some semi-meaningful fourth or fifth decimal, and some programs may omit the estimated standard deviations on the atomic coordinates, or even on the unit-cell parameters. When you want to do an energy minimisation anyway, this should not make any difference, as these estimated standard deviations do not affect the final result anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Also, please suggest any free wares that can&lt;br/&gt;&gt; do this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WinGX:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/~louis/software/wingx/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Platon:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cryst.chem.uu.nl/spek/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best wishes,&lt;br/&gt;--&lt;br/&gt;Dr Jacco van de Streek&lt;br/&gt;Department of Pharmacy&lt;br/&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ccl.net/cgi-bin/ccl/message-new?2013+03+05+007</guid><pubDate>Tue, 5 Mar 2013 17:44:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CCL: ROCS: Openeye software</title><link>http://ccl.net/cgi-bin/ccl/message-new?2013+03+04+001</link><description>Hi Everyone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I want to use ROCS software of openeye software to compare a query molecule=&lt;br/&gt; =&lt;br/&gt;to database of compounds(conformations), WITHOUT ALIGNING THE DATABASE =&lt;br/&gt;COMPOUNDS TO THE QUERY COMPOUND, using color score in ROCS.

Your thoughts made me realize that identifying the shape of the molecule could be a fast approach in concluding differences in symmetry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, I would though like to stress that benzene has a C6V symmetry, and perhaps that is the root of my concern in equalizing O2 with Cyclohexane, and alienating Cyclohexane from benzene. Yes benzene and cyclohexane have a enormous difference in structure, but O2 and cyclohexane have an even more larger difference. I would therefore presume that there should be an additional criteria to separate these 3 from one another in a sound way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For instance, only benzene and O2 have an inversion center. However, the inversion center applied in cyclohexane yields its mirror image, not its inverse. This should actually alienate cyclohexane from both O2 and Benzene "by miles".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The infinite axis in O2 separates it yet from both benzene and cyclohexane, thus pushing cyclohexane closer to benzene in symmetry. But all three vary so much from one anther, that they should belong in fact to an own point group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Point group O2: infinite axis defines uniqueness&lt;br/&gt;Point group benzene: inversion center define uniqueness&lt;br/&gt;Point group cyclohexane: "Improper" inversion center defines uniqueness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks Harry again, and all the best&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sergio&lt;br/&gt;----- Original Message -----&lt;br/&gt;&gt; From: HARRY STERN hstern16__mac.com&lt;br/&gt;Sent: 03/02/13 04:58 AM&lt;br/&gt;To: Manzetti, Sergio &lt;br/&gt;Subject: CCL: Question on Symmetry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;hi Sergio, clearly Jim didn't know the answer. Whenever someone expresses impatience with a question, it is always for that reason and means it is a good question. I didn't know either (it's been a while since I had group theory) but I found these pages very helpful &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_groups_in_three_dimensions &lt;br/&gt;http://www.chem.uky.edu/research/Grossman/stereo/pointgroups.HTML &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;after reading those, I would say that the essential difference between the dihedral groups and the cyclic groups is that the former have additional rotational symmetry (in addition to the primary symmetry of rotation about an axis). The latter do not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a dihedral family of point groups, but within that family, there are many different groups (in fact, infinitely many). So in fact, cyclohexane and O2 have different point groups, as you would expect for such different-looking molecules.&lt;br/&gt;The point group for the chair conformation of cyclohexane is D3d, while homonuclear diatomics have the same point group as a cylinder, D inf h. Benzene has the point group D6h (just like a cylinder, but a six-fold axis of symmetry instead of an infinite-fold axis). Also - if you don't consider just a single conformation of cyclohexane, but think of the average structure on a longer timescale where it can interconvert between chair and boat, it has exactly the same symmetry as benzene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;hope I've got all this right&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;best - Harry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Mar 1, 2013, at 9:55 AM, Jim Kress ccl_nospam:+:http://kressworks.com  &lt; owner-chemistry*ccl.net &gt; wrote:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you actually read or studied any of the many references to Symmetry and the use of Symmetry in Chemistry?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Try these:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;â€œChemical Applications of Group Theoryâ€, F.

Winners (or &lt;br/&gt;their adviser, if necessary) will be the Principal Investigator of a new &lt;br/&gt;account on the kraken Cray XT5 supercomputer at the National Institute of &lt;br/&gt;Computational Sciences (NICS), with an allocation of computing time to &lt;br/&gt;support the project. For information about kraken, see &lt;br/&gt;http://www.nics.tennessee.edu/computing-resources/kraken. Allocations will be &lt;br/&gt;determined based on the requested amount and consideration of resource &lt;br/&gt;availability.  Up to 2 awardees will be chosen on the basis of: the &lt;br/&gt;significance of the project plan, the potential impact on the project of &lt;br/&gt;obtaining additional supercomputer resources, the qualifications of the &lt;br/&gt;student, and the strength of the supporting letter and other materials. &lt;br/&gt;Projects with modest computational needs that can be performed on individual &lt;br/&gt;machines or small clusters are not likely to be competitive.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Application requirements include a title and extended abstract of the work &lt;br/&gt;(no more than 1 page), a two page CV, a brief letter of support from the &lt;br/&gt;research advisor, and a 1-2 page detailed computational plan indicating: &lt;br/&gt;computational resources already available for the project, the types of &lt;br/&gt;calculations to be performed, experience of the applicant with high &lt;br/&gt;performance computing, availability of software, justification of number and &lt;br/&gt;length of runs, parallel scaling data, and an estimate of the total time &lt;br/&gt;needed.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Submit the application to carlos.simmerling ]|[ stonybrook.edu as a SINGLE pdf &lt;br/&gt;or text file, and include your last name at the start of the file name. Use &lt;br/&gt;the subject ACS Kollman AWARD APPLICATION. There is a limit of one Kollman &lt;br/&gt;Award application per research lab (PI). Previous winners are not eligible.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The application deadline is 5pm EDT on Friday, March 15. Applicants will &lt;br/&gt;receive email confirmation of receipt of materials. If you do not receive &lt;br/&gt;confirmation by midnight March 18, please contact the organizer immediately &lt;br/&gt;by email.  Winners are encouraged but not required to present their work &lt;br/&gt;within the COMP program at the meeting, either in oral or poster format. If &lt;br/&gt;you want to present your work in an oral or poster presentation, you must &lt;br/&gt;also submit your abstract using the ACS PACS system, prior to the PACS &lt;br/&gt;deadline. Application for the supercomputing award does not constitute an &lt;br/&gt;application for a presentation.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;More information on awards offered by the ACS COMP division can be found on &lt;br/&gt;the web site at http://www.acscomp.org/Awards/index.html  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Carlos Simmerling&lt;br/&gt;Chair, ACS COMP Division Awards Committee&lt;br/&gt;Professor, Department of Chemistry&lt;br/&gt;Stony Brook University&lt;br/&gt;Stony Brook, NY 11794-3400&lt;br/&gt;carlos.simmerling ]|[ stonybrook.edu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ccl.net/cgi-bin/ccl/message-new?2013+03+02+006</guid><pubDate>Sat, 2 Mar 2013 08:01:55 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>CCL: On Symmetry</title><link>http://ccl.net/cgi-bin/ccl/message-new?2013+03+02+007</link><description>Yes, and I can probably sell you one too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But answer me on this Felipa Pineda Pideca, why are diatomic molecules belonging to a group called Dihedrals, when you need minimum of three atoms to define a dihedral?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sergio the bikemaker.&lt;br/&gt;----- Original Message -----&lt;br/&gt;&gt; From: Felipe Pineda pideca : hotmail.com&lt;br/&gt;Sent: 03/02/13 03:20 PM&lt;br/&gt;To: Manzetti, Sergio &lt;br/&gt;Subject: CCL: On Symmetry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;it looks like u r reinventing the bike&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;wikipedia is ur friend&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;&gt; From: owner-chemistry^^^ccl.net&lt;br/&gt;To: fpineda^^^uni-bonn.de&lt;br/&gt;Subject: CCL: On Symmetry&lt;br/&gt;Date: Sat, 2 Mar 2013 11:29:04 +0100&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subdivision of the three examples:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;O2&lt;br/&gt;Benzene&lt;br/&gt;Cyclohexane&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;could be best organized if O2 was assigned to a A.inf. group, instead of D.inf..

These molecules are so different, that one would prefer to &gt; put the cyclohexane in the same group with benzene for instance. The similarity of the compounds does not really play a role for the symmetry classification. Also note that for e.g. cyclohexane, the point group depends on the time scale you are looking at, one snapshot would be D3, while on longer timescales with many conformational changes it should become D6h (or something like that).

The start&lt;br/&gt;is coming soon (March 4th), and we hope you can participate.  Check&lt;br/&gt;www.CSARdock.org for more details as they become available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exercise is built around designed proteins developed by Tinberg, &lt;br/&gt;Khare, and Baker.  This is an interesting twist on traditional&lt;br/&gt;docking/scoring problems because there is no existing protein data on&lt;br/&gt;which to train models (as was possible in the first two exercises).&lt;br/&gt;We plan to have three phases, with a possible fourth phase:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 1: Protein design  Over one dozen proteins were designed to &lt;br/&gt;bind a steroid.  Can you determine which were successful?&lt;br/&gt;(timeframe: 1 month)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 2: Scoring  Given the set-up crystal structures of the proteins&lt;br/&gt;and a set of pregenerated docking decoys, can you identify the correct&lt;br/&gt;poses for the steroid? (timeframe: 2 weeks)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 3: Selectivity  Given the set-up crystal structures of some&lt;br/&gt;protein-steroid complexes, can you predict the binding affinity (or&lt;br/&gt;relative ranking) of several steroids binding to the same protein?&lt;br/&gt;(timeframe: 1 month)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 4: Predict the effect of protein mutations  There is extensive&lt;br/&gt;mutational data available.

Whenever someone =&lt;br/&gt;expresses impatience with a question, it is always for that reason and =&lt;br/&gt;means it is a good question.  I didn't know either (it's been a while =&lt;br/&gt;since I had group theory) but I found these pages very helpful=20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_groups_in_three_dimensions&lt;br/&gt;http://www.chem.uky.edu/research/Grossman/stereo/pointgroups.HTML&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;after reading those, I would say that the essential difference between =&lt;br/&gt;the dihedral groups and the cyclic groups is that the former have =&lt;br/&gt;additional rotational symmetry (in addition to the primary symmetry of =&lt;br/&gt;rotation about an axis).  The latter do not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a dihedral family of point groups, but within that family, =&lt;br/&gt;there are many different groups (in fact, infinitely many).  So in fact, =&lt;br/&gt;cyclohexane and O2 have different point groups, as you would expect for =&lt;br/&gt;such different-looking molecules.&lt;br/&gt;The point group for the chair conformation of cyclohexane is D3d, while =&lt;br/&gt;homonuclear diatomics have the same point group as a cylinder, D inf h.  =&lt;br/&gt;Benzene has the point group D6h (just like a cylinder, but a six-fold =&lt;br/&gt;axis of symmetry instead of an infinite-fold axis).  Also - if you don't =&lt;br/&gt;consider just a single conformation of cyclohexane, but think of the =&lt;br/&gt;average structure on a longer timescale where it can interconvert =&lt;br/&gt;between chair and boat, it has exactly the same symmetry as benzene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;hope I've got all this right&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;best - Harry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Mar 1, 2013, at 9:55 AM, Jim Kress ccl_nospam:+:kressworks.com =&lt;br/&gt;&lt;owner-chemistry^^ccl.net&gt; wrote:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Have you actually read or studied any of the many references to =&lt;br/&gt;Symmetry and the use of Symmetry in Chemistry?&lt;br/&gt;&gt; =20&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Try these:&lt;br/&gt;&gt;=20&lt;br/&gt;&gt; =93Chemical Applications of Group Theory=94, F.

It expects as many molecular orbitals as there are basis functions. This is not the case if orbitals have been removed because of near linear dependencies. Try adding the following to your keywords:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  IOP(3/59=7)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This changes the threshold for removing functions from the default of 1^-6 to 1^e-7. If that's not enough, increase the number to 8 or 9. It will take more iterations but is unlikely to cause errors. HF and DFT are fairly insensitive to linear dependency. If you use post-HF correlation methods, things may look different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HTH.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Herbert&lt;br/&gt;________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&gt; From: owner-chemistry+herbert.fruchtl==st-andrews.ac.uk+/-ccl.net [owner-chemistry+herbert.fruchtl==st-andrews.ac.uk+/-ccl.net] on behalf of Amir Babalhavaeji ababalha!^!chem.utoronto.ca [owner-chemistry+/-ccl.net]&lt;br/&gt;Sent: 27 February 2013 21:26&lt;br/&gt;To: Herbert Fruchtl&lt;br/&gt;Subject: CCL:G: Viewing a Formatted Checkpoint File&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sent to CCL by: "Amir  Babalhavaeji" [ababalha_-_chem.utoronto.ca]&lt;br/&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have run an optimization/frequency job using Gaussian 09 on a remote cluster system.

It expects as many molecular orbitals as there&lt;br/&gt;are basis functions. This is not the case if orbitals have been removed&lt;br/&gt;because of near linear dependencies. Try adding the following to your&lt;br/&gt;keywords:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  IOP(3/59=7)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This changes the threshold for removing functions from the default of 1^-6&lt;br/&gt;to 1^e-7. If that's not enough, increase the number to 8 or 9. It will take&lt;br/&gt;more iterations but is unlikely to cause errors. HF and DFT are fairly&lt;br/&gt;insensitive to linear dependency. If you use post-HF correlation methods,&lt;br/&gt;things may look different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HTH.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Herbert&lt;br/&gt;________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&gt; From: owner-chemistry+herbert.fruchtl==st-andrews.ac.uk!^!ccl.net&lt;br/&gt;&gt; [owner-chemistry+herbert.fruchtl==st-andrews.ac.uk!^!ccl.net] on &lt;br/&gt;&gt; behalf of Amir Babalhavaeji ababalha!^!chem.utoronto.ca &lt;br/&gt;&gt; [owner-chemistry!^!ccl.net]&lt;br/&gt;Sent: 27 February 2013 21:26&lt;br/&gt;To: Herbert Fruchtl&lt;br/&gt;Subject: CCL:G: Viewing a Formatted Checkpoint File&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sent to CCL by: "Amir  Babalhavaeji" [ababalha_-_chem.utoronto.ca] Hello&lt;br/&gt;everyone,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have run an optimization/frequency job using Gaussian 09 on a remote&lt;br/&gt;cluster system.

It is difficult =&lt;br/&gt;to tell from your output what&lt;br/&gt;is going on, as I believe the calculation simply ran out of steps and =&lt;br/&gt;did not converge to a minimum yet.&lt;br/&gt;However, there is some indication that the optimization is slowly =&lt;br/&gt;converging. Possibly you got trapped=20&lt;br/&gt;in a very shallow part of the potential energy surface and the =&lt;br/&gt;optimization is oscillating.=20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thing to do would certainly be to increase the number of geometry =&lt;br/&gt;iterations (Niter in the geometry block,&lt;br/&gt;please check the ADF manual, which is also available online. ) and =&lt;br/&gt;re-run the calculation from your last geometry.&lt;br/&gt;Having said that, it is of course always good to understand first what =&lt;br/&gt;is going on, rather than increasing=20&lt;br/&gt;this number without thinking about it, as in this case this game could =&lt;br/&gt;go on forever.  =20&lt;br/&gt;You might want to play around with the convergence criteria (smaller to =&lt;br/&gt;start with) and/or decrease the step size to probe=20&lt;br/&gt;the PES more carefully and ultimately find the minimum energy structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternatively you could modify your structure a bit and trim it down, so =&lt;br/&gt;you arrive at a simplified version&lt;br/&gt;of your complex, which might be easier to optimize. Inspecting your last =&lt;br/&gt;geometry it looks like some atoms start&lt;br/&gt;to get a little too close, although I can't spot any severe problem here =&lt;br/&gt;at this stage. The whole thing just looks&lt;br/&gt;a bit crowded. Maybe you could replace the butyl side chains with =&lt;br/&gt;methyl? =20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another thing to possibly do would be to scan potential conformations of =&lt;br/&gt;the complex using a force field,&lt;br/&gt;so you get an idea where possible minima are located. You can then use =&lt;br/&gt;these pre-optimized structures=20&lt;br/&gt;to fully optimize the geometry with you chosen DFT method.   =20&lt;br/&gt;=20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope this helps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tobias&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;__________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Tobias Kr=E4mer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Max-Planck-Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion&lt;br/&gt;Stiftstrasse 34-36&lt;br/&gt;D-45470 M=FClheim an der Ruhr&lt;br/&gt;Germany&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;|  phone	|   +49 (0)208 306 3584&lt;br/&gt;|  email	|   tobias.kraemer:cec.mpg.de&lt;br/&gt;__________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Am 27.02.2013 um 12:46 schrieb Ajita Banthiya =&lt;br/&gt;ajita.banthiya19.:.gmail.com:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt;=20&lt;br/&gt;&gt;

The equation =&lt;br/&gt;for calculating the pKa is given by your=20&lt;br/&gt;first equation, which you have correctly formulated. According to the =&lt;br/&gt;thermodynamic cycle, what needs to be calculated first&lt;br/&gt;is the vacuum Gibbs Free Energy difference (DeltaG_gas) between the the =&lt;br/&gt;deprotonated species (A-) and the protonated species (AH),&lt;br/&gt;and then, in the second step, add the difference of their Free Enegies =&lt;br/&gt;of solvation (DeltaDeltaG_sol). This latter step transfers the gas phase =&lt;br/&gt;reaction into the=20&lt;br/&gt;condensed phase, i.e. solution.=20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that the Free energy of the proton as well as its solvation energy =&lt;br/&gt;are also needed in the equation, but these are known and thus have been&lt;br/&gt;collected into the constant terms that occur in the initial equation =&lt;br/&gt;(plus terms concerning the standard state as well as the 2.303RT =&lt;br/&gt;value)). =20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I guess you have assumed DeltaG_solv (X) =3D G_gas (x) + DeltaG_s (X)=20=&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;but DeltaG_solv(X) =3D DeltaG_s(X),&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and hence the G_gas terms do not cancel.=20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One has to perform gas phase optimizations in order to obtain the values =&lt;br/&gt;for gas phase Free Energies G_gas of the individual species, and =&lt;br/&gt;additionally perform=20&lt;br/&gt;calculations in solution phase (using a polarizable continuum for =&lt;br/&gt;example), which will yield the Free Energy of Solvation for the =&lt;br/&gt;individual&lt;br/&gt;species.=20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tobias=20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;__________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Tobias Kr=C3=A4mer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Max-Planck-Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion&lt;br/&gt;Stiftstrasse 34-36&lt;br/&gt;D-45470 M=C3=BClheim an der Ruhr&lt;br/&gt;Germany&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;|  phone	|   +49 (0)208 306 3584&lt;br/&gt;|  email	|   tobias.kraemer#cec.mpg.de&lt;br/&gt;__________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Am 27.02.2013 um 04:38 schrieb Roby Kurian Roby_Kurian#,#umit.maine.edu:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Hi all,&lt;br/&gt;&gt;=20&lt;br/&gt;&gt; The equation for calculating pKa as detailed by Liptak in the 2001 =&lt;br/&gt;paper, (JACS 2001, 123, 7314) is&lt;br/&gt;&gt;=20&lt;br/&gt;&gt; pKa =3D { Ggas(A=E2=80=BE) =E2=80=93 Ggas(AH) =E2=80=93 =CE=94Gsolv(AH) =&lt;br/&gt;+ =CE=94Gsolv(A=E2=80=BE) =E2=80=93 269.0 }/1.3644&lt;br/&gt;&gt;=20&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Now, If the =CE=94Gsolv terms are expanded, this equation comes to,&lt;br/&gt;&gt;=20&lt;br/&gt;&gt; pKa =3D { Ggas(A=E2=80=BE) =E2=80=93 Ggas(AH) =E2=80=93 Gsolv(AH) + =&lt;br/&gt;Ggas(AH) + Gsolv(A=E2=80=BE) =E2=80=93 Ggas(A=E2=80=BE)  =E2=80=93 269.0 =&lt;br/&gt;}/1.3644&lt;br/&gt;&gt;=20&lt;br/&gt;&gt; and four of the terms cancel out, giving&lt;br/&gt;&gt;=20&lt;br/&gt;&gt; pKa =3D { Gsolv(AH) + Gsolv(A=E2=80=BE) =E2=80=93 269.0 }/1.3644&lt;br/&gt;&gt;=20&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Both Liptak's paper and couple of other references that use this =&lt;br/&gt;method, mention gas phase calculations were employed in determination of =&lt;br/&gt;pKa.&lt;br/&gt;&gt; So my question is, since only two terms (solvated free energy of the =&lt;br/&gt;protonated and deprotonated species) come in the final expression and it =&lt;br/&gt;doesn't consider the gas phase free energies, is it necessary to do the =&lt;br/&gt;gas phase calculations ? or am I missing something here?&lt;br/&gt;&gt;=20&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Thanks for any suggestions.&lt;br/&gt;&gt;=20&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Roby Kurian&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Graduate student&lt;br/&gt;&gt; University of Maine&lt;br/&gt;&gt;=20&lt;br/&gt;&gt;=20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ccl.net/cgi-bin/ccl/message-new?2013+02+27+008</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Feb 2013 17:33:46 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>CCL: pKa calculation using Gaussian</title><link>http://ccl.net/cgi-bin/ccl/message-new?2013+02+27+009</link><description>&lt;br/&gt;Sent to CCL by: John Keith [john.keith_-_gmail.com]&lt;br/&gt;Dear Roby, as Prof. Knapp said, there are multiple ways of going about&lt;br/&gt;these calculations.

Thus,&lt;br/&gt;you can do a single point on the last geometry and check your orbital&lt;br/&gt;orbital occupations as required by Aufbau principle.&lt;br/&gt;Otherwise,&lt;br/&gt;Let me know if ts works !&lt;br/&gt;Lotfi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2013/2/27, Ajita Banthiya ajita.banthiya19.:.gmail.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;owner-chemistry~!~ccl.net&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Sent to CCL by: "Ajita  Banthiya" [ajita.banthiya19^^^gmail.com]&lt;br/&gt;&gt; hi. i am trying to optimize the gemetry using ADF program but i am facing&lt;br/&gt;&gt; problem it is not converging plase suggest me some solutions ..here is my&lt;br/&gt;&gt; input file and the output results.&lt;br/&gt;&gt; INPUT FILE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; &lt;Feb27-2013&gt; &lt;01:27:11&gt;  current energy&lt;br/&gt;&gt; -33.14339879 Hartree&lt;br/&gt;&gt; &lt;Feb27-2013&gt; &lt;01:27:11&gt;  energy change                       0.00111387&lt;br/&gt;&gt; 0.00100000    F&lt;br/&gt;&gt; &lt;Feb27-2013&gt; &lt;01:27:11&gt;  constrained gradient max            0.00088668&lt;br/&gt;&gt; 0.00100000    T&lt;br/&gt;&gt; &lt;Feb27-2013&gt; &lt;01:27:11&gt;  constrained gradient rms            0.00016711&lt;br/&gt;&gt; 0.00066667    T&lt;br/&gt;&gt; &lt;Feb27-2013&gt; &lt;01:27:11&gt;  gradient max                        0.00088668&lt;br/&gt;&gt; &lt;Feb27-2013&gt; &lt;01:27:11&gt;  gradient rms                        0.00016711&lt;br/&gt;&gt; &lt;Feb27-2013&gt; &lt;01:27:11&gt;  cart. step max                      0.32289033&lt;br/&gt;&gt; 0.01000000    F&lt;br/&gt;&gt; &lt;Feb27-2013&gt; &lt;01:27:11&gt;  cart. step rms                      0.07532210&lt;br/&gt;&gt; 0.00666667    F&lt;br/&gt;&gt; &lt;Feb27-2013&gt; &lt;01:27:11&gt;  ERROR: GEOMETRY DID NOT CONVERGE&lt;br/&gt;&gt; &lt;Feb27-2013&gt; &lt;01:27:11&gt;  NORMAL TERMINATION&lt;br/&gt;&gt; &lt;Feb27-2013&gt; &lt;01:27:12&gt;  END&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- &lt;br/&gt;Pr.

But, keep on your mind, our SCF aid convergence, if&lt;br/&gt;problem still recurrent for you.&lt;br/&gt;Good cheer&lt;br/&gt;lotfi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2013/2/27, Pere Miro pere.miro=gmail.com &lt;owner-chemistry_._ccl.net&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Sent to CCL by: Pere Miro [pere.miro_._gmail.com]&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Hi Ajita,&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; you should increase the number of geometry optimization cycles (I think the&lt;br/&gt;&gt; default is 30).&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; GEOMETRY&lt;br/&gt;&gt; ITERATIONS 100&lt;br/&gt;&gt; END&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; You can also use the last geometry (in your output) and continue the&lt;br/&gt;&gt; geometry optimization from it.&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt;

cf. ADF manual !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADF can handle pretty large molecules no problem as long as you have &lt;br/&gt;enough physical cores to do the job and enough time to lead it to &lt;br/&gt;completion: "shaky alkyls" are always an issue...as you never know &lt;br/&gt;whether the minimum you reached is a true absolute one or not...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;160 atom molecules with transition metals are not so uncommon in our lab &lt;br/&gt;for geom_opt jobs and for freq. calcs too on 15 cores at a time !&lt;br/&gt;Freq calc just take ca. 1 month to finish...you better have a good &lt;br/&gt;geometry convergence !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;by the way, does anyone know when is the disclosure of the 2013 version &lt;br/&gt;planned ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jean-Pierre&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le 27/02/2013 16:49, Tobias Kraemer tobias.kraemer.:.cec.mpg.de a écrit :&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Dear Ajita,&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; I have looked at your structure and I get the impression that this a &lt;br/&gt;&gt; relatively large ligand with&lt;br/&gt;&gt; extended side chains (butyl residues and phenyl rings). It is &lt;br/&gt;&gt; difficult to tell from your output what&lt;br/&gt;&gt; is going on, as I believe the calculation simply ran out of steps and &lt;br/&gt;&gt; did not converge to a minimum yet.&lt;br/&gt;&gt; However, there is some indication that the optimization is slowly &lt;br/&gt;&gt; converging. Possibly you got trapped&lt;br/&gt;&gt; in a very shallow part of the potential energy surface and the &lt;br/&gt;&gt; optimization is oscillating.&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; One thing to do would certainly be to increase the number of geometry &lt;br/&gt;&gt; iterations (Niter in the geometry block,&lt;br/&gt;&gt; please check the ADF manual, which is also available online. ) and &lt;br/&gt;&gt; re-run the calculation from your last geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Having said that, it is of course always good to understand first what &lt;br/&gt;&gt; is going on, rather than increasing&lt;br/&gt;&gt; this number without thinking about it, as in this case this game could &lt;br/&gt;&gt; go on forever.&lt;br/&gt;&gt; You might want to play around with the convergence criteria (smaller &lt;br/&gt;&gt; to start with) and/or decrease the step size to probe&lt;br/&gt;&gt; the PES more carefully and ultimately find the minimum energy structure.&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Alternatively you could modify your structure a bit and trim it down, &lt;br/&gt;&gt; so you arrive at a simplified version&lt;br/&gt;&gt; of your complex, which might be easier to optimize. Inspecting your &lt;br/&gt;&gt; last geometry it looks like some atoms start&lt;br/&gt;&gt; to get a little too close, although I can't spot any severe problem &lt;br/&gt;&gt; here at this stage. The whole thing just looks&lt;br/&gt;&gt; a bit crowded. Maybe you could replace the butyl side chains with methyl?&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Another thing to possibly do would be to scan potential conformations &lt;br/&gt;&gt; of the complex using a force field,&lt;br/&gt;&gt; so you get an idea where possible minima are located. You can then use &lt;br/&gt;&gt; these pre-optimized structures&lt;br/&gt;&gt; to fully optimize the geometry with you chosen DFT method.&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Hope this helps&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt;

As =&lt;br/&gt;previously mentioned, It can be very cpu-time/memory consuming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are some answers to your questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1- No.&lt;br/&gt;You only rarely need to start by calculating force constants, at least when=&lt;br/&gt; optimizing a system toward a minimum of the PES.&lt;br/&gt;By default, Gaussian estimates the force constants (eq. to  opt=3Dnewestmfc=&lt;br/&gt;) that will be used in the minimization algorithm at the beginning (with a =&lt;br/&gt;valence force field, which is not time consuming). Furthermore, along the o=&lt;br/&gt;ptimization, the hessian matrix is updated. 2nd derivatives are used in met=&lt;br/&gt;hods such as ones based on Newton-Raphson approach, e.g.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2- Same answer as above but with a precision: for a minimum search, things =&lt;br/&gt;happen generally well, in most of the cases, calcfc is not needed.&lt;br/&gt;When you are looking for a transition state, things are different: you have=&lt;br/&gt; to provide a proper hessian matrix (see Gaussian User's manual for TS sear=&lt;br/&gt;ch, which can be a tricky task, sometimes), which means that either you pro=&lt;br/&gt;vide it from a previous calculation or calculate it with calcfc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3- Almost a linear combination of the two previous answers:&lt;br/&gt;When looking for a minimum, the use of calcfc is rarely (even almost never)=&lt;br/&gt; needed. But when looking for a TS, this is needed if you don't provide the=&lt;br/&gt; hessian from a previous calculation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To finish, I absolutely want to "modulate" my answers: every chemical syste=&lt;br/&gt;m is particular and will behave a particular way. Hence, the calculation of=&lt;br/&gt; the hessian matrix before a minimum search could be needed, as already wri=&lt;br/&gt;tten by Jean-Jules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope this clarified things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway,I suggest you to  have a look at Gaussian09 User's reference, especi=&lt;br/&gt;ally: http://www.gaussian.com/g_tech/g_ur/k_opt.htm which describes very pr=&lt;br/&gt;ecisely the use of different keywords related to optimization methods. I wo=&lt;br/&gt;uld also suggest some further readings about optimization techniques and al=&lt;br/&gt;gorithms like in chapter 12 (p380, 2nd edition) of F. Jensen's "Introductio=&lt;br/&gt;n to Computational Chemistry"  or section 4 of chapter 2 (pp 40-46) in C.

So I want to check whether a set of DFTs method are suitable for predicting the structure and intermolecular interactions involved by compounds that include Si-O-Si linkage. However, I am not sure which kind of methods can be used as the standards to evaluate their performance. The result of MP2 method in combination with large basis set is normally choosed as benchmark. Howevere, I found that MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ seems apparently overestimate the complexation energy. Is their lies any other choice?

A series of MDs were done over simple salt gradients from 0.015-400 mM just NaCl and KCl, and showed the affinities from the raw MDs ranged from something like 6-30 kCal/mol compared to something like 4-10 kCal/mol determined by Plasmon resonance, (raw affinities not fed into the IC50 formulas compared with Gromacs)...basically the precision of calculated affinities becomes extremely dependent on solvent, which the closer the solvent is to the conditions used to measure it the more precises the MDs work, and that seems to become complicated as not just salts, but buffers, etc can make the MD complicated, but if someone did a series of sets for common solvent buffers, etc  it would become quite easy to set...as these could then be used as a standard library for personal, or uploaded larger body of people...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And for other things such as proteins, the approximations stop working as they become protein specific as they do not follow similar laws as the small molecule systems...then time of simulations becomes the problem as their kinetics are in the seconds range, instead of pico or nano seconds, so a single system without applied force can take a large amount of simulation time, however they have been done and seem to fit reality from MD simulations if one has the time.  Still, protein kinetics or affinities seem to fit published affinities better with less solvent effects, more temperature than small molecules (why? I assume most sims use at least simple salts, but I havn't seen much else on why?), even simple Kd, or delG with pulled, or applied force...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program in Gromacs g_lie has a paper reference to approximations which can be fed in, such as below, and works reasonably well with small molecules at least in some calculations I did at one point, both by hand using their alpha/beta correction constants, but the paper shows these are based on series of calculated affinities for small molecules, and a correction constant determined from these, and that there is a few cases these did not work possible from large amounts of hydrophobic effects (the authors assumptions), etc...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So from a computer side, its limited in either the formulas you would use in say a simple calculation (ranging from 2 inputs, to inputs including solvents, protein molarity, etc...) and the more included, such as solvent, etc...the more accurate, or&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a complex system, using say Gromacs or NAMD, the more the solvent reflects the reality of what you wish to measure, ie say plasma, or inter-cellular, or in vitro with salts, buffers, etc..., the more precise it would determine your desired kinetics.  These simulations though represent Gaussians, and then just average, say about 10 runs, you would get very realistic measurements...or using just a g_lie, a good approximation for smaller systems if your molecules dont depend too much on hydrophobic interactions, you could also just look up the formulas from the g_lie paper and do those by hand if you have already some base things, or just the generalized formulas for IC50 from Vmax and Km, but you also have to come up with molarity corrections which arnt presented in most of the formulas for these (if you just look them up in a standard kinetic book or wiki), but they're there, in literature if you look a day,but if you have raw measurements is probably faster than simulations...hope thats not to much.  The Gromacs mailing list has some of the raw calculation formulas buried in it over 8 years as well, but the included molarities, etc...you would have to change for your system,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most accurate though would be just Gromacs with your protein system, good solvent including salts, buffers or whats expected, repeated as above and calculate DelG, with each of your other molecules as well, or a quick raw approximation such as from literature...I dont know if its a project or something else though...so hope that helps, but that can take time on a large cluster...  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I should also say, if you have one or two known affinities from a hard calculation, such as plasmon, the others can also be done by using simple formulas, and the correction made by fitting your by hand calculations to the one you've already done empirically (do those by hand with the same calculation, the correction is the difference) which is usually a simple shift which would apply to each small molecule, but again thats simple one or two atom changes and not completely different molecules, the g_lie type method...in any case some ideas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stephan Watkins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-------- Original-Nachricht --------&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Datum: Sat, 23 Feb 2013 11:16:38 -0500&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Von: "Denis Kazakiewicz d.kazakiewicz__gmail.com" &lt;owner-chemistry- -ccl.net&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; An: "Watkins, Steve " &lt;lloyd.riggs- -gmx.ch&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Betreff: CCL: From Docking to Enzyme kinetics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&gt; Sent to CCL by: "Denis  Kazakiewicz" [d.kazakiewicz|,|gmail.com]&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Hello&lt;br/&gt;&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&gt; The task is to calculate IC50 for different new inhibitors of enzyme with&lt;br/&gt;&gt; known Vmax and Km&lt;br/&gt;&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&gt; Is it doable?&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Which software is "better" to use?&lt;br/&gt;&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&gt; Best regards&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Denis&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ccl.net/cgi-bin/ccl/message-new?2013+02+25+002</guid><pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2013 13:00:19 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>CCL: Database of solvation energies</title><link>http://ccl.net/cgi-bin/ccl/message-new?2013+02+25+003</link><description>&lt;br/&gt;Sent to CCL by: "Ramon  Crehuet" [rcsqtc * iqac.csic.es]&lt;br/&gt;Dear all,&lt;br/&gt;I would like to get the *experimental* solvation energy (in water) of HPO4^(2-) and HAsO4^(2-) (I want to compare with calculated values).

I was wondering if this option "calcfc" must be always use in the optimizations, or I can avoid it?&lt;br/&gt;2. If I avoid the "calcfc", am I going to obtain a bad optimization?&lt;br/&gt;3. are there certain cases in which is better to use it and cases in which I can avoid it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you all for the help&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raphael&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ccl.net/cgi-bin/ccl/message-new?2013+02+25+007</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Feb 2013 08:49:09 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>CCL: the keyword SMD</title><link>http://ccl.net/cgi-bin/ccl/message-new?2013+02+25+008</link><description>&lt;br/&gt;Sent to CCL by: "Hanane  Louanas" [hananelouanas!=!yahoo.fr]&lt;br/&gt;Dear Sir/Madam&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I want to know what is the keyword "SMD" and when to use him? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;br/&gt;H.Louanas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ccl.net/cgi-bin/ccl/message-new?2013+02+25+008</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Feb 2013 10:10:24 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>CCL:G: the keyword SMD</title><link>http://ccl.net/cgi-bin/ccl/message-new?2013+02+25+009</link><description>Dear Louanas,=0A=0ASMD is the keyword you=0Awant to use when performing a S=&lt;br/&gt;elf Consistent Reaction Field (SCRF) calculation=0Awith G09.

A series of MDs were done over simple salt gradients from 0.015-400 mM just NaCl and KCl, and showed the affinities from the raw MDs ranged from something like 6-30 kCal/mol compared to something like 4-10 kCal/mol determined by Plasmon resonance, (raw affinities not fed into the IC50 formulas compared with Gromacs)...basically the precision of calculated affinities becomes extremely dependent on solvent, which the closer the solvent is to the conditions used to measure it the more precises the MDs work, and that seems to become complicated as not just salts, but buffers, etc can make the MD complicated, but if someone did a series of sets for common solvent buffers, etc  it would become quite easy to set...as these could then be used as a standard library for personal, or uploaded larger body of people...&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; And for other things such as proteins, the approximations stop working as they become protein specific as they do not follow similar laws as the small molecule systems...then time of simulations becomes the problem as their kinetics are in the seconds range, instead of pico or nano seconds, so a single system without applied force can take a large amount of simulation time, however they have been done and seem to fit reality from MD simulations if one has the time.  Still, protein kinetics or affinities seem to fit published affinities better with less solvent effects, more temperature than small molecules (why? I assume most sims use at least simple salts, but I havn't seen much else on why?), even simple Kd, or delG with pulled, or applied force...&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; The program in Gromacs g_lie has a paper reference to approximations which can be fed in, such as below, and works reasonably well with small molecules at least in some calculations I did at one point, both by hand using their alpha/beta correction constants, but the paper shows these are based on series of calculated affinities for small molecules, and a correction constant determined from these, and that there is a few cases these did not work possible from large amounts of hydrophobic effects (the authors assumptions), etc...&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; So from a computer side, its limited in either the formulas you would use in say a simple calculation (ranging from 2 inputs, to inputs including solvents, protein molarity, etc...) and the more included, such as solvent, etc...the more accurate, or&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; In a complex system, using say Gromacs or NAMD, the more the solvent reflects the reality of what you wish to measure, ie say plasma, or inter-cellular, or in vitro with salts, buffers, etc..., the more precise it would determine your desired kinetics.  These simulations though represent Gaussians, and then just average, say about 10 runs, you would get very realistic measurements...or using just a g_lie, a good approximation for smaller systems if your molecules dont depend too much on hydrophobic interactions, you could also just look up the formulas from the g_lie paper and do those by hand if you have already some base things, or just the generalized formulas for IC50 from Vmax and Km, but you also have to come up with molarity corrections which arnt presented in most of the formulas for these (if you just look them up in a standard kinetic book or wiki), but they're there, in literature if you look a day,but if you have raw measurements is probably faster than simulatio!&lt;br/&gt;&gt;   ns...hope thats not to much.  The Gromacs mailing list has some of the raw calculation formulas buried in it over 8 years as well, but the included molarities, etc...you would have to change for your system,&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; The most accurate though would be just Gromacs with your protein system, good solvent including salts, buffers or whats expected, repeated as above and calculate DelG, with each of your other molecules as well, or a quick raw approximation such as from literature...I dont know if its a project or something else though...so hope that helps, but that can take time on a large cluster...&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; I should also say, if you have one or two known affinities from a hard calculation, such as plasmon, the others can also be done by using simple formulas, and the correction made by fitting your by hand calculations to the one you've already done empirically (do those by hand with the same calculation, the correction is the difference) which is usually a simple shift which would apply to each small molecule, but again thats simple one or two atom changes and not completely different molecules, the g_lie type method...in any case some ideas&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Sincerely,&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Stephan Watkins&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; -------- Original-Nachricht --------&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&gt; Datum: Sat, 23 Feb 2013 11:16:38 -0500&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&gt; Von: "Denis Kazakiewicz d.kazakiewicz__gmail.com"&lt;owner-chemistry++ccl.net&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&gt; An: "Watkins, Steve "&lt;lloyd.riggs++gmx.ch&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&gt; Betreff: CCL: From Docking to Enzyme kinetics&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&gt; Sent to CCL by: "Denis  Kazakiewicz" [d.kazakiewicz|,|gmail.com]&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&gt; The task is to calculate IC50 for different new inhibitors of enzyme with&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&gt; known Vmax and Km&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it doable?&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&gt; Which software is "better" to use?&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&gt; Best regards&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&gt; Denis&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ccl.net/cgi-bin/ccl/message-new?2013+02+25+011</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Feb 2013 22:43:07 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>CCL: Magnetic susceptibility calculated by G09</title><link>http://ccl.net/cgi-bin/ccl/message-new?2013+02+24+001</link><description>&lt;br/&gt;Sent to CCL by: "Ambrish K.

Refer to this &lt;br/&gt;link: http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Geometry_examples&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don't think it's possible to define which point group you want using &lt;br/&gt;Gaussian. You can only tell Gaussian the maximum (not minimum!) symmetry &lt;br/&gt;to use using symm(PG= ) keyword. Gaussian will decide if your starting &lt;br/&gt;geometry has any symmetry, within certain tolerances. You can use the &lt;br/&gt;symm=loose to "snap" a nearly symmetric molecule into the closest point &lt;br/&gt;group.
