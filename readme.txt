Brief history of Linux4Chemistry

Linux4Chemistry (l4c to save typing) was set up by Nikodem Kuznik in 2001 and was hosted at http://zeus.polsl.gliwice.pl/~nikodem/linux4chemistry.html. Until the end of 2005 Nikodem was the sole maintainer and editor.

At that point, Noel O'Boyle got in touch regarding adding some icons for open source code, and since Nikodem felt that he no longer had the time to keep updating the page, Noel arranged to take over the maintainence of the website, which was now hosted at http://www.redbrick.dcu.ie/~noel/linux4chemistry/. Nikodem remained as editor along with Paul Czodrowski.

The main changes to the website at this stage were:
(1) addition of a searchable form
(2) new logos for everything
(3) more emphasis on licenses, rather than prices
(4) addition of a feedback form

The main changes to the data were:
(1) all program data updated
(2) license information added
(3) non-chemistry software removed
(4) on request, chemistry software added

At the end of July 2006, the next stage in the evolution of l4c occurred. A project website was established at the Google Code hosting site. This allowed the creation of the infrastructure required for collaboration on linux4chemistry: subversion repository, and mailing lists. In addition, a del.icio.us account was created to store bookmarks of websites to be investigated for software. Rajarshi Guha was added as editor.

What is chemistry software?
===========================

What we say it is, basically. :-)

We want to look after chemists and the rest can look after themselves. So...it should not include bioinformatics software nor software for structural biology (although this is a grey area). Remember that if you include one piece of software from a particular area, you need to include them all - this should make you think twice about including things.

Chemical engineering too...forget about it, although I must admit that there are two chem eng. softwares on the list [Aug 1 2006].

What is physics and what is chemistry? Let's avoid the philosophy, and consider things to do with molecules chemistry, while everything else is suspect. It's important to be consistent though.

Should l4c have a bias towards open source software?
====================================================
No. This is the basis on which l4c has been passed on from Nikodem, and this is the reason that people use the site...because it has everything. Personally, we may feel different, but it's important that l4c is reasonably neutral :-)
