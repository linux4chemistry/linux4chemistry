The feature set is limited to those necessary to enter a single chemical species, in a form that might be used in a cheminformatic database, representing each atom and bond as a part of a labelled graph.

It can be used for comparison of molecular dynamics simulations or other models of atomistic structure of the material with X-ray and neutron powder diffraction experiments.

Using the OpenBabel API, it can import/export in a wide variety of file formats including CML. A notable feature is that it can automatically parse linear fragments to create a 2D structure.
