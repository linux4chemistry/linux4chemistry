<p><span class="l4c">Linux4Chemistry</span> classifies software into five categories, which are defined as follows:</p>
<table width="90%" align="center">
<tr>
<td align="center"><img src="opensource_big.png"/></td>
<td align="center"><p>Open Source<p></td>
<td><p class="programdescription">This is software which is available at no cost, for which the source code is freely available, and which can be freely modified and distributed. More specifically, <span class="l4c">Linux4Chemistry</span> defines as Open Source software which is either public domain, released under an OSI (<a href="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source Initiative</a>)-<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/">approved license</a>, or whose license appears to be compatible with an OSI-approved license.</p></td>

<td align="center"><p>Free for academics</p></td>
<td><p class="programdescription">This is software which is available at no cost only to those using it for research purposes, at not-for-profit institutes, or for non-commercial purposes. You need to look carefully at the license for the software to see whether you will be charged for its use. Note: some software is available for free to academics only from a particular country. This has been classified as commercial software but a note is appended to the software description.</p></td></tr>

<td align="center"><p>Shareware</p></td>
<td><p class="programdescription">This is software which can be freely distributed and which may be used at no cost for a trial period, beyond which it must be paid for. Note: this category should really be merged with Commercial software, as several commercial programs are also available at no cost for a trial period.</p></td></tr>
